# Python GPT Character-Based Model
This project includes implementation of a simple GPT model working on a character level. This model employs attention and transformer blocks often used in modern natural language processing tasks.

## Getting Started
To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, you can clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
With the provided functions, a GPT model can be trained on a character dataset, in this case, the 'tinyshakespeare' dataset.
